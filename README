SCCC: Self Contained C Compiler
===============================

The project aims to provide a complete and self-contained implementation of a C compiler. It is designed to not rely on external dependencies or libraries (except those that are trivial to implement), including parser generators. This project is intended to be educational and serve as a learning resource for understanding the internals of a compiler.
